        <b>Better Rest</b> <a href="https://github.com/JayBhensdadia/BetterRest"> <img src="./github_logo.png" width="20px"></a> | <i>Swift, SwiftUI, CoreML</i><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Developed an innovative app, Better Rest, targeting coffee drinkers to improve their sleep quality.</li>
            <li>Implemented a user-friendly interface to gather essential sleep-related information by asking users specific questions, such as their desired wake-up time, preferred sleep duration, and daily coffee consumption.</li>
            <li>Leveraged CoreML, the machine learning framework in iOS, to integrate a pre-trained ML model into the app. This ML model predicts the optimal sleep time based on the inputs provided by the users.</li>
        </ul>

            <li>The app presents players with a random eight-letter word and challenges them to create smaller words from it.</li>
            <li>Implemented a word validation system to cross-check user entries against the letters available in the starter word.</li>
            <li>Incorporated user feedback and alerts to provide real-time responses on correct and incorrect word entries.</li>
            <li>Utilized Swift and XCode to implement the game mechanics and logic. Designed an engaging user interface with SwiftUI.
